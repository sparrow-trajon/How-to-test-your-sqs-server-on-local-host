This is the code for the Amazon Sqs Message Queue.
Here I try to give a very simple and basic solution to this problem.
lets first understand the problem....what excatly we have to do..!!!
        we have Amazozn weeb services, SQS(Simple Queue services), which provide a lot of web sevvices.
        our prime focus on the SQS, which stands for the Simple QUEUE Services, Mean we can create queue and manipulate the operation on them.
        lets have the idea about the basic code structure.
        1. Connection class, which is responsible for making the connection request to the server, in case you want to test it on the local server.
            then you must set the endpoint to the local web host.
        2. Producer class, which is responsible for the creating the queue request, creating the messages either in bacth or just simple message
            requets. which will be sent the server.
        3.consumer class, which is responsible for receiving all the message which are there in the queue and processing all the messages.
            after processing will delete the message.
            

connection class is being set to test the test on the local server.
